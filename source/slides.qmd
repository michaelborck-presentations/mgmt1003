## $440,000

::: {.notes}
Pause for 2-3 seconds before speaking.

"$440,000. That's what the Australian government paid Deloitte for a welfare review report earlier this year."
:::

## The Deloitte Case

**What happened:**

- Deloitte used AI (GPT-4) to draft government reports
- Reports contained **fabricated citations** - fake studies, made-up quotes
- Australia: $440,000 welfare review - partial refund issued
- Canada: $1.6 million healthcare report - 4 incorrect citations found

**The lesson:** AI is confident even when wrong. Verification is essential.

::: {.notes}
"Their reputation—built over decades—damaged by AI-generated misinformation they didn't verify. Today, I'm going to teach you how to use AI as a strategic thinking partner - and how to avoid becoming the next headline."

## Part 1: The AI Mindset

## AI is a Smart Intern Who Hallucinates

**Key insight:** AI is a **reasoning engine**, not a search engine

- Google finds information that exists
- AI generates responses based on patterns
- It doesn't "know" things - it predicts likely responses

**The Intern Analogy:**

> Think of AI like a brilliant intern. They're eager, fast, and can do amazing work. But they might confidently present completely made-up statistics.

## The Golden Rule

::: {.center}
**AI should challenge your thinking, not replace it.**
:::

The moment you stop questioning AI's output is the moment you become Deloitte.

**Your role:** Editor-in-Chief, not stenographer.

## Part 2: Board of Directors Strategy

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

**The concept:** Get multiple expert viewpoints in one prompt

- CFO perspective (financial)
- Marketing Director (customers)
- Operations Manager (practical)
- Legal Counsel (compliance)

**Why it works:** Catches blind spots you'd miss thinking alone

## Demo: Board of Directors Prompt

```
I'm considering opening a cashless coffee shop 
near a university campus. 

Act as my board of directors and analyse this 
idea from multiple perspectives:

1. As CFO: Financial considerations, risks, ROI?
2. As Marketing Director: Positioning and reach?
3. As Operations Manager: Practical challenges?
4. As Legal Counsel: Regulations to consider?

For each perspective, give me 3-4 key points.

## Your Turn: Try It

Think of a business idea:

- A meal prep delivery service for students
- A tutoring app connecting students with graduates  
- A sustainable fashion rental service
- Your own idea

**Try the Board of Directors prompt with your idea.**

## Part 3: Devil's Advocate

## Overcoming Confirmation Bias

**The problem:** We look for evidence that supports our ideas

**The solution:** Force AI to argue against your position

**Key phrases that work:**

- "Be harsh but fair"
- "Don't hold back"
- "I need to hear the hard truths"

## Demo: Devil's Advocate Prompt

```
I believe that a cashless coffee shop near 
a university is a great business idea.

Play devil's advocate. Give me the strongest 
possible arguments against this idea. 
Be harsh but fair. I want to know:

1. Why might this fail?
2. What am I probably not thinking about?
3. Who would this NOT work for?
4. What market conditions could kill this?

Don't hold back - I need to hear the hard truths.
```

## Part 4: Reverse Prompting

## When You Don't Know What to Ask

**The problem:** Sometimes the hardest part is knowing what questions to ask

**The solution:** Let AI interview YOU first

**Why it works:** 

- AI understands your specific context
- Recommendations become tailored, not generic
- You discover what you don't know

## Demo: Reverse Prompting

```
I want to create a marketing plan for a new 
cashless coffee shop near a university.

Before giving me any advice, interview me first. 
Ask me questions one at a time to understand:
- My target customers
- My budget and timeline
- My competitive advantages
- My experience in this industry
- Any constraints I'm working with

After you understand my situation, then give 
me tailored marketing recommendations.

Start with your first question.
```

::: {.notes}
Run this demo. Answer 2-3 questions from the AI to show how the conversation builds context.

## Part 5: Ethics & The Trap

## The Billboard Rule

**Before sharing anything with AI, ask:**

> "Would I be comfortable if this appeared on a billboard?"

**Never share:**

- Passwords or API keys
- Personal information about others
- Confidential business data
- Anything you wouldn't want made public

## The Hallucination Trap

Remember Deloitte? Here's why it happened:

1. **AI doesn't know it's lying** - It generates plausible text
2. **Confidence ≠ Accuracy** - AI sounds equally confident right or wrong
3. **Pattern matching, not truth** - AI predicts likely responses

## The Three Verification Questions

Before trusting any AI output, ask:

1. **Can I find this source independently?**
2. **Does this statistic appear elsewhere?**
3. **Does this make logical sense?**

If you can't verify it, don't use it.

## Resources & Next Steps

## Key Takeaways

1. AI is a thinking partner, not a replacement for thinking
2. Use **multi-perspective prompting** (Board of Directors)
3. **Challenge your ideas** (Devil's Advocate)
4. Let AI **interview you** for better context (Reverse Prompting)
5. **Always verify** - never trust blindly
