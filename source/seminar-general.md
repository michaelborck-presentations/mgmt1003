# **Session Title: The AI Boardroom – Leveraging AI for Business Strategy**
**Target Audience:** Introduction to Business Students (Undergraduate)
**Time:** 60 Minutes (Online)

## **Part 1: The Mindset (10 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Shift thinking from "Search Engine" to "Reasoning Engine."

* **The "Intern" Analogy:** Explain that AI is like a smart, hardworking intern who hallucinates occasionally. It needs clear instructions (Context) and verification (Oversight).
* **The Golden Rule:** *AI should not replace your thinking; it should challenge your thinking.*
* **Visual Aid:** 

## **Part 2: The "Board of Directors" Strategy (15 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Use your "CEO/Board" idea to teach **Multi-Persona Prompting**. This is highly relevant for business students learning about different organizational roles.

* **Concept:** instead of asking AI for *one* answer, ask it to simulate *three* conflicting business perspectives.
* **The Activity (Live Demo):** Pick a simple business idea (e.g., "A coffee shop that doesn't accept cash").
* **The Prompt:**
    > "Act as a Board of Directors for a new startup. The board consists of:
    > 1.  **A Skeptical CFO** (Focused on risk and cash flow).
    > 2.  **An Optimistic Marketing Director** (Focused on virality and brand).
    > 3.  **An Operations Manager** (Focused on logistics).
    >
    > Discuss the pros and cons of opening a 'Cashless-Only' coffee shop in a tourist district. Debate amongst yourselves and provide a final recommendation."
* **Why this works:** It teaches students that business decisions are multifaceted.

## **Part 3: The Devil’s Advocate (10 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Use the **Debate/Pros-Cons** strategy to reduce confirmation bias.

* **Concept:** Students often fall in love with their first business idea. Use AI to tear it apart.
* **The Prompt:**
    > "I believe that [Insert Business Strategy] is the best course of action. Act as a ruthless competitor or a critical investor. 'Steelman' the argument *against* my strategy. Tell me exactly why this might fail."
* **Lesson:** This teaches resilience and critical analysis, not just text generation.

## **Part 4: Reverse Prompting (10 Minutes)**
**Goal:** Use the **Tutor/Consultant** approach to clarify problem definitions.

* **Concept:** Sometimes we don't know what to ask. Let the AI interview *us*.
* **The Prompt:**
    > "I want to create a marketing plan for a sustainable fashion brand, but I don't know where to start. Ask me 5 specific questions about my business, one by one. Once I answer them, generate a tailored marketing strategy for me."
* **Lesson:** The quality of the output depends on the quality of the input (Garbage In, Garbage Out).

## **Part 5: Ethics & The "Trap" (10 Minutes)**
**Goal:** A "light" touch on ethics focused on **Data Privacy** and **Hallucination**.

* **The Privacy Rule:** "If you wouldn't put it on a billboard, don't put it in a public LLM." (Mention Samsung/Apple internal data leaks as examples).
* **The Bias Trap:** Briefly mention that AI is trained on historical internet data, which contains historical business biases (e.g., expecting CEOs to be male).
* **The "Fact Check" Challenge:** Remind them that AI is a language model, not a knowledge model. It sounds confident even when it is wrong.

## **Part 6: Q&A and Wrap Up (5 Minutes)**

1.  **Prompting Framework:** **The CREATE Framework** (Context, Role, Explicit Instruction, Audience, Tone, Execute) – A simple acronym for business students to remember See: https://medium.com/aimonks/chatgpt-power-prompts-cheatsheet-c-r-e-a-t-e-framework-for-prompting-b852b2b9b248.
2.  **Reading:** **"One Useful Thing" by Ethan Mollick.** (https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) Highly recommended for business students. His articles on AI as a "co-intelligence" are very accessible.
3.  **Tool:** **Microsoft WorkLab.** (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/) Good for corporate examples of how AI is actually being used in the Fortune 500.
