## Opening Hook: The Deloitte Case (3 minutes)

### Slide 1: Title Slide
*Display while being introduced*

### Slide 2: "$440,000"

**Script:**

> "$440,000."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds]*
>
> "That's what the Australian government paid Deloitte for a welfare review report earlier this year. And $1.6 million for a Canadian healthcare report."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "Both reports contained fabricated citations. Fake studies. Made-up quotes. The AI Deloitte used to draft these reports hallucinated - it invented sources that didn't exist. And Deloitte's consultants never caught it."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "Deloitte had to issue partial refunds. They're now facing industry-wide calls for stricter oversight. Their reputation - built over decades - damaged by AI-generated misinformation they didn't verify."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "Today, I'm going to teach you how to use AI as a strategic thinking partner for business decisions - and more importantly, how to make sure you never become the next Deloitte headline."

### Slide 3: Deloitte Case Summary
*Brief visual reinforcement of the case*

**Transition:** "Let's start with understanding what AI actually is - and isn't."

## Part 1: The AI Mindset (10 minutes)

### Slide 4: "Part 1: The AI Mindset"
*Chapter marker*

### Slide 5: "AI is a Smart Intern Who Hallucinates"

**Key Points to Cover:**

1. **AI is a reasoning engine, not a search engine**
   - Google finds information that exists
   - AI generates responses based on patterns
   - It doesn't "know" things - it predicts likely responses

2. **The Intern Analogy**
   > "Think of AI like a brilliant intern. They're eager, fast, and can do amazing work. But they also might confidently present you with completely made-up statistics because they want to impress you. Your job is to be their editor-in-chief, not their stenographer."

3. **The Golden Rule**
   > "AI should challenge your thinking, not replace it. The moment you stop questioning AI's output is the moment you become Deloitte."

**Discussion Prompt (optional):**
> "Quick question for the chat: How many of you have used ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude before? Drop a 1 for yes, 2 for no."

**Transition:** "Now let's look at our first technique for using AI strategically."

## Part 2: Board of Directors Strategy (15 minutes)

### Slide 6: "Part 2: Board of Directors Strategy"
*Chapter marker*

### Slide 7: The Prompt

**Concept Explanation (2 minutes):**

> "When you're making a business decision, you want multiple perspectives. In a real company, you'd have a board of directors - each with different expertise and concerns. The CFO cares about money. The Marketing Director cares about customers. Operations cares about feasibility."
>
> "We can use AI to simulate this boardroom. One prompt, multiple expert perspectives."

**Demo Prompt (Display on slide and in Gemini):**

```
I'm considering opening a cashless coffee shop near a university campus. 
Act as my board of directors and analyse this idea from multiple perspectives:

1. As CFO: What are the financial considerations, risks, and potential ROI?
2. As Marketing Director: How would you position this and reach the target market?
3. As Operations Manager: What are the practical challenges of going cashless?
4. As Legal Counsel: What regulations or legal issues should I consider?

For each perspective, give me 3-4 key points to consider.
```

**Run Demo (5 minutes):**
- Paste prompt into Gemini
- Wait for response
- Highlight key insights from each "director"

**Discussion Points:**
- Notice how each perspective catches different issues
- CFO might flag payment processing fees
- Legal might flag accessibility concerns (not everyone has cards)
- This is faster than consulting 4 different experts

**Student Activity (5 minutes):**

> "Now it's your turn. Think of a business idea - it could be something you've thought about, or use one of these:
> - A meal prep delivery service for students
> - A tutoring app connecting students with recent graduates
> - A sustainable fashion rental service
>
> Try the same prompt structure with your idea. Paste the results in the chat if you'd like to share."

**Transition:** "Great responses coming in. Now, what if you want AI to poke holes in your idea?"

## Part 3: Devil's Advocate Technique (10 minutes)

### Slide 8: "Part 3: Devil's Advocate"
*Chapter marker*

### Slide 9: The Prompt

**Concept Explanation (2 minutes):**

> "Confirmation bias is real. When we have an idea we love, we tend to look for evidence that supports it and ignore evidence against it. This is dangerous in business."
>
> "The Devil's Advocate technique forces AI to argue against your position. Not because your idea is bad, but because understanding weaknesses makes your idea stronger."

**Demo Prompt:**

```
I believe that a cashless coffee shop near a university is a great business idea.

Play devil's advocate. Give me the strongest possible arguments against this idea. 
Be harsh but fair. I want to know:

1. Why might this fail?
2. What am I probably not thinking about?
3. Who would this NOT work for?
4. What market conditions could kill this business?

Don't hold back - I need to hear the hard truths.
```

**Run Demo (4 minutes):**
- Paste prompt into Gemini
- Point out how AI identifies blind spots
- Discuss how this strengthens decision-making

**Key Point:**

> "Notice I said 'be harsh but fair' and 'don't hold back.' Without that instruction, AI tends to be polite. You need to give it permission to be critical."

**Transition:** "But what if you don't even know what questions to ask?"

---

## Part 4: Reverse Prompting (10 minutes)

### Slide 10: "Part 4: Reverse Prompting"
*Chapter marker*

### Slide 11: The Prompt

**Concept Explanation (2 minutes):**

> "Sometimes the hardest part isn't getting answers - it's knowing what to ask. Reverse prompting flips the script. Instead of you asking AI questions, you ask AI to interview you."
>
> "This is incredibly powerful when you're starting something new and don't know what you don't know."

**Demo Prompt:**

```
I want to create a marketing plan for a new cashless coffee shop near a university.

Before giving me any advice, interview me first. Ask me questions one at a time 
to understand:
- My target customers
- My budget and timeline
- My competitive advantages
- My experience in this industry
- Any constraints I'm working with

After you understand my situation, then give me tailored marketing recommendations.

Start with your first question.
```

**Run Demo (5 minutes):**
- Paste prompt into Gemini
- Answer 2-3 of AI's questions
- Show how responses become more tailored

**Key Point:**

> "See how the advice becomes specific to YOUR situation? Generic prompts get generic answers. When AI understands your context, it gives you actionable insights."

**Student Activity (2 minutes):**

> "Think about an assignment or project you're working on. Try asking AI to interview you about it before giving advice. You'll be surprised how much better the output is."

**Transition:** "Now, before we wrap up, we need to talk about the dark side."

## Part 5: Ethics & The Trap (10 minutes)

### Slide 12: "Part 5: Ethics & The Trap"
*Chapter marker*

### Slide 13: The Billboard Rule & Hallucinations

**The Billboard Rule (3 minutes):**

> "Before you put anything into AI, ask yourself: Would I be comfortable if this appeared on a billboard?"
>
> "Never share:
> - Passwords or API keys
> - Personal information about others
> - Confidential business data
> - Anything you wouldn't want made public
>
> AI providers may use your inputs for training. Assume nothing is private."

**Hallucinations - Back to Deloitte (4 minutes):**

> "Remember Deloitte? They trusted AI-generated citations without checking. Here's the thing about AI hallucinations:"

Key points:
1. **AI doesn't know it's lying** - It generates plausible-sounding text, not verified facts
2. **Confidence ≠ Accuracy** - AI sounds equally confident whether right or wrong
3. **Always verify** - Especially citations, statistics, and factual claims

**The Three Verification Questions:**
1. Can I find this source independently?
2. Does this statistic appear elsewhere?
3. Does this make logical sense?

**Bias Awareness (2 minutes):**

> "AI is trained on human-generated data. That means it absorbs human biases. If you ask AI to describe a 'successful CEO,' it might default to male examples. If you ask about 'typical customers,' it might make assumptions based on stereotypes."
>
> "Your job is to notice when AI might be reflecting bias, not truth."

**Transition:** "Let's wrap up with where to go from here."

## Wrap-up & Resources (2 minutes)

### Slide 14: Resources & Next Steps

**Key Takeaways:**
1. AI is a thinking partner, not a replacement for thinking
2. Use multi-perspective prompting (Board of Directors)
3. Challenge your ideas (Devil's Advocate)
4. Let AI interview you for better context (Reverse Prompting)
5. Always verify, never trust blindly

**Share Resources:**
- Companion website URL (display QR code)
- Student handout with all prompts

**Closing:**

> "The students who will succeed in business aren't the ones who avoid AI or blindly trust it. They're the ones who learn to collaborate with it effectively - while keeping their critical thinking sharp."
>
> "The tools we covered today will serve you in this course and in your careers. Use them wisely."
