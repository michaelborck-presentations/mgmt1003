# Why This Matters

AI tools will be part of your professional toolkit in HR, finance, supply chain, marketing, information systems, and professional services. The question isn't whether you'll use AI—you will. The question is whether you'll use it **competently and ethically**.

This guide helps you:

- Understand when and how to use AI **transparently**
- Develop **critical oversight** skills that employers value
- Make informed decisions about **data governance**
- Build habits that serve you in both university and your career

# 1. The Real Stakes

You might hear people ask: "Isn't using AI just cheating?"

A better question is: **"How do I use AI responsibly so it helps me learn and prepares me for my career?"**

Why this reframing matters:

- **Old thinking:** AI is a shortcut to avoid; the goal is to hide its use
- **New thinking:** AI literacy is a professional skill; the goal is transparent, critical, responsible use

The real risk isn't that you use AI—it's that you use it **incompetently or unethically**. That's what will hurt you in both your studies and your career.

# 2. Three-Part Framework for Ethical AI Use

Use this framework to guide your AI use in coursework and beyond.

## 2.1 Transparency (Not Secrecy)

**Principle:** Make your AI use explicit rather than hidden.

**What this means for you:**

- Know when AI is **expected, permitted, or not permitted** for each task
- Be ready to **explain how you used AI** and what you did with its output
- Focus on **how you use and critique AI**, not on hiding that you used it
- Get credit for **identifying and correcting AI's errors**

**Why it matters:** When you're transparent about AI use, you develop professional habits of documenting your process. Secret use means you're not learning—just outsourcing.

## 2.2 Critical Oversight (Not Blind Trust)

**Principle:** AI is a tool that requires your judgement, not an authority to trust.

**What this means for you:**

- **Critique, correct, and improve** AI outputs—don't just copy-paste
- Identify **what AI got wrong or missed** for your specific context
- Remember: your work is judged by the **quality of your thinking**, not AI's first answer
- Watch for **hallucination, bias, oversimplification, or wrong jurisdiction**

**Why it matters:** Thoughtful use is harder than blind reliance. You're building professional habits of checking context, evidence, and consequences before acting on AI recommendations.

## 2.3 Professional Relevance (Not Academic Shortcut)

**Principle:** Connect your AI use to how you'll use it in real workplaces.

**What this means for you:**

- Think of coursework as **practice for professional scenarios**
- Consider **workplace ethics and accountability**: Who is responsible when AI is wrong?
- Build **AI literacy** as a skill that makes you more valuable to employers

**Why it matters:** AI isn't a shortcut around academic work—it's a **tool you must learn to handle responsibly** for your career.

# 3. Data Governance: Protecting Information

When you use AI tools, you're making decisions about data security—often without realising it. Understanding the difference between enterprise and consumer tools is a professional skill.

## 3.1 Enterprise vs Consumer Tools

| Tool Type | Examples | Data Handling | Use For |
|-----------|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Enterprise/Approved** | MS Copilot Enterprise, institutional tools | Data stays within institution, not used to train public models | Course materials, assessments, case data |
| **Consumer/Free** | ChatGPT free, Gemini free, public web interfaces | May be retained, used to improve services, less transparent | General brainstorming, concept exploration only |

## 3.2 What You Should Never Upload to Free AI Tools

- Confidential or identifying information about real people or organisations
- Unpublished course materials or other students' work
- Assessment answers or submissions
- Anything you wouldn't post publicly on social media

## 3.3 Good Practice

When using public AI tools:

1. **De-identify first**: Remove names, specific details, identifying information
2. **Use fictional scenarios**: When exploring sensitive topics
3. **Document your process**: Keep track of key prompts and decisions
4. **Be prepared to explain**: What you used, how you checked it, what you changed

This isn't just about following rules—it's about building habits that protect you and others in your professional career.

# 4. Understanding AI Expectations in Coursework

Different tasks have different expectations. Here's a typical framework:

## When AI is Expected
- Activities specifically designed to teach AI skills
- Critiquing AI outputs
- Stress-testing your work with AI feedback

## When AI is Permitted
- Brainstorming ideas
- Generating practice questions
- Checking grammar or clarity
- Exploring concepts you don't fully understand yet

## When AI is Not Permitted
- Closed-book exams
- Tasks that explicitly say "no AI tools"
- Always check your unit outline for specific guidance

## When You Use AI, You Must:

1. **Treat it as support for your thinking**, not a replacement
2. **Critically evaluate** outputs and adapt them for the specific context
3. **Be able to explain and defend** your work in your own words
4. **Acknowledge AI use** when required (e.g., "I used Copilot to draft initial bullet points, then revised them based on X, Y, Z")

**Important:** Using AI to avoid thinking, or submitting AI output as if it were entirely your own work, is **academic misconduct**—and it also means you're not learning the skills you're paying to develop.

# 5. Why "AI-Proof" Assessments Actually Help You

You might encounter assessments designed to require your genuine thinking. Here's why that's good for you:

## Process Over Product
Instead of just submitting a polished final product, you might be asked to show your decisions, what you would change, and your self-assessment. This builds skills employers actually want.

## Visible Thinking
You might be asked to critique AI-generated solutions, choose the best approach, and explain what AI missed. This is exactly what professionals do—AI becomes your **starting point**, not your answer.

## Context Matters
Tasks tied to specific simulations, placements, or local contexts require you to adapt generic AI output to real situations. This is a core professional skill.

## Iteration and Reflection
Submitting drafts, revisions, and reflections shows your learning process. This mirrors how real projects work—nobody gets it right the first time.

**The bottom line:** Assessments that require your genuine engagement aren't obstacles—they're opportunities to build skills that make you valuable.

# 6. Self-Check: Are You Using AI Well?

Before submitting work, ask yourself:

| Question | Good Sign | Warning Sign |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Can I explain every part of this work? | Yes, I understand it deeply | I'm not sure what some parts mean |
| Does it fit the specific context? | Addresses local details, correct jurisdiction | Generic, could apply to anything |
| Did I show my process? | Clear evidence of my thinking | Just a polished final product |
| Could I defend this in a conversation? | Absolutely, I did the thinking | I'd struggle to explain my reasoning |

**If you have warning signs:** Go back and do the thinking. Use AI as a tool to help you understand, not to replace your understanding.

---

# 7. Your Action Step

Create your own **personal AI use policy**. Write down:

1. **What I'll use AI for:** (brainstorming, checking my work, exploring concepts)
2. **What I won't use AI for:** (replacing my thinking, final submissions without review)
3. **How I'll stay accountable:** (always be able to explain my work, document my process)
4. **How I'll protect data:** (de-identify, use approved tools for sensitive content)

This isn't just an academic exercise—it's preparation for your career. Professionals who can articulate and follow responsible AI practices are more valuable than those who can't.
