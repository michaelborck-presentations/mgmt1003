# Meta-Skills for Learning

## The Unique Power of AI

Here's something remarkable: **AI can teach you how to use itself.**

This is fundamentally different from traditional tools. Excel can't teach you how to use Excel. PowerPoint can't guide you through using PowerPoint. Email can't help you email better.

But AI can.

Why? Because AI can:

- Ask you diagnostic questions
- Understand context about your role and challenges
- Evaluate its own recommendations
- Refine advice based on your feedback
- Serve as a patient, tireless thinking partner

This creates a unique opportunity: **You can use AI to discover how to use AI better.**

---

## The Core Insight: Meta-Prompting

Here's the key: Instead of asking AI to directly solve a problem, you can ask AI to help you figure out how to ask AI for help.

**Example comparison:**

| Direct Approach | Meta Approach |
|---|---|
| "How should I answer this question?" | "What's the best way to frame this question for an AI so I get useful help?" |
| "Give me strategies for using AI in my teaching." | "Ask me questions to understand my teaching context, then recommend both obvious and unexpected ways I could use AI." |
| "How do I improve my workflow?" | "Interview me about my role and responsibilities, then suggest AI tools and strategies I might not have considered." |

The meta approach is more powerful because **AI asks you clarifying questions first**, learns your context, and then provides recommendations tailored to your actual situation—not generic advice for a hypothetical educator or professional.

## The Consultation Prompt: Your Starting Point

Here's a prompt you can use immediately. Copy it, paste it into your AI tool of choice (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, etc.), and adapt it to your role:

```
You're an AI expert consultant. I'd love your help understanding how I could
better use AI in my work.

Please ask me one question at a time. I'll answer, then you'll ask the next
question. Keep asking until you understand:
- My role and responsibilities
- My main workflows and challenges
- My key objectives and KPIs (what matters for success)
- My constraints (time, resources, skills, institutional requirements)

Once you have enough context, provide TWO types of recommendations:
1. Obvious opportunities: Clear, straightforward AI applications
   (the low-hanging fruit most people think of)
2. Non-obvious opportunities: Unexpected or creative uses of AI I might not
   have considered

Format your recommendations clearly with implementation tips for each.
```

**That's it.** Paste that prompt and start answering questions. You're about to have one of the most useful conversations about AI you could possibly have.

## Why This Works: The Interview Advantage

When you ask AI to interview you before making recommendations, several things happen:

### 1. **Contextual Depth**
AI doesn't know anything about you initially. By asking sequential questions, it builds a comprehensive picture of:

- Your discipline and teaching/research/operational context
- Your students, colleagues, or stakeholders
- Your constraints and resources
- What success looks like for you

This context is invaluable. Generic AI advice for "educators" doesn't account for the fact that you teach engineering capstones, or manage compliance for a large faculty, or support early-career researchers. Context changes everything.

### 2. **Both Obvious and Non-Obvious Ideas**
AI tends to suggest obvious applications first (automating grading, generating ideas, answering questions). Those are valuable, but they're predictable.

By asking for both obvious *and* non-obvious recommendations, you push AI to think more creatively:

- **Obvious:** Use AI to generate discussion questions for your seminar
- **Non-obvious:** Use AI as a "skeptical peer reviewer" to critique your teaching materials before students see them
- **Non-obvious:** Use AI to help you understand common misconceptions your students hold (based on their questions and assignments)
- **Non-obvious:** Use AI to design assessments that are harder for AI to cheat on

The non-obvious ideas are often where the real value lies.

### 3. **Self-Evaluation and Refinement**
AI is remarkably good at evaluating its own suggestions. When it generates a list of recommendations, it can:

- Assess which are most feasible for your context
- Identify trade-offs
- Refine implementation strategies
- Suggest variations or combinations

This creates a feedback loop where recommendations get better through iteration.

### 4. **Collaborative Discovery**
Unlike reading a guide or taking a course, this is a conversation. You're not passively receiving advice—you're actively shaping it by:

- Answering questions honestly
- Pushing back on ideas that don't fit
- Asking follow-up questions
- Exploring implications

The back-and-forth is where deep learning happens.

## A Real Example: What This Conversation Looks Like

Here's a simplified example of how the conversation might unfold:

### **Your Initial Prompt:**
*[You paste the consultation prompt above]*

### **AI's First Question:**
> "Thanks for that. Let's start with the basics. What's your primary role? Are you an educator, researcher, administrator, or something else? And what's your discipline or field?"

### **You:**
> "I'm a teaching coordinator in the business faculty. I manage unit approvals, coordinate teaching support across 15 units, and help faculty integrate new teaching approaches."

### **AI's Next Question:**
> "That's helpful context. What's your biggest pain point right now? What's taking up most of your time or causing the most frustration?"

### **You:**
> "Definitely the administrative stuff. Tracking who needs what support, scheduling meetings, writing emails summarising policies to faculty who haven't read them, managing compliance documentation."

### **AI's Next Question:**
> "I hear you. Now, thinking about your faculty members—what's one thing they struggle with that you think AI could help them with? And what's one thing *you* struggle with in supporting them?"

### **You:**
> "Faculty struggle with writing clear learning outcomes and designing assessments. And I struggle with translating compliance requirements into plain language they actually understand."

### **AI's Next Question:**
> "Perfect—those are solvable with AI. One more: What would success look like for you? If you had more time back and your faculty felt better supported, what would change?"

### **You:**
> "I'd have time for strategic work instead of just admin. And faculty would feel confident designing assessments without constantly asking me questions."

### **AI's Synthesis:**
> "Okay, I have enough context. Here are my recommendations:

> **OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES:**
> - Use AI to draft plain-language policy summaries for faculty
> - Use AI to help faculty write learning outcomes (with your review)
> - Use AI to generate assessment design templates

> **NON-OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES:**
> - Use AI to analyse faculty questions/emails and identify common gaps in understanding, then create targeted guidance
> - Use AI as a 'quality check' tool: paste a unit outline and ask it to flag compliance risks or unclear learning outcomes
> - Use AI to design a simple chatbot or FAQ that answers routine faculty questions about policies
> - Use AI to help you create training materials that explain 'why' policies exist, not just 'what' they are"

See the difference? The AI didn't just rattle off generic suggestions. It understood your specific role, constraints, and challenges. The recommendations are contextual and actionable.

## How to Use This Guide Alongside Others

This guide is foundational because it helps you **discover your own starting point**. After using AI to interview you, you might then:

1. **Dive deeper into specific techniques:**
   - If AI recommends using prompts with students, explore the **Seven Essential Techniques**
   - If AI suggests using AI for analysis and reporting, explore **C.R.A.F.T. Prompting** and **Prompt Chaining**
   - If you're new to AI generally, start with **What is AI?** and **What are LLMs?**

2. **Use AI to help you understand other guides:**
   - "I'm reading a guide about prompt chaining. Can you ask me questions about my use case, then explain how prompt chaining would help?"
   - "I don't fully understand the C.R.A.F.T. framework. Can you interview me about a specific prompt I want to write, then help me structure it using CRAFT?"

3. **Return to this guide periodically:**
   - Your role, context, and goals change. Run this consultation quarterly
   - Each time, you'll discover new opportunities you're ready for now that you weren't before
   - This keeps your AI strategy aligned with your evolving priorities

---

## Variations: Tailored Consultation Prompts

Depending on your role, you might adapt the consultation prompt:

### For Educators
```
You're an AI expert in pedagogical technology. Ask me questions about my teaching
(students, discipline, learning goals, constraints) so you can recommend both
obvious and non-obvious ways to use AI to enhance student learning without
replacing authentic work.
```

### For Researchers
```
You're an AI expert in research methodology. Ask me about my research area,
methods, and challenges. Then recommend both obvious and non-obvious ways AI
could support my research process (not the research itself, but the process).
```

### For Professional Staff
```
You're an AI expert in academic operations. Ask me about my role (responsibilities,
workflows, stakeholders, success metrics). Then recommend both obvious and
non-obvious ways AI could help me work more strategically and reduce administrative burden.
```

### For Anyone New to AI
```
You're an AI expert in helping people discover their relationship with AI.
Ask me questions about my work, my goals, what frustrates me, what excites me.
Then recommend how I could start experimenting with AI in ways that matter to me.
```

## The Deeper Principle: AI as a Mirror

Here's what's really happening when you ask AI to interview you:

**AI acts as a mirror for your own thinking.**

By asking clarifying questions, AI forces you to articulate:

- What you actually do (vs. what you think you do)
- What matters most (vs. what's just urgent)
- What's possible (vs. what feels impossible)
- What you haven't tried (because you didn't know it was possible)

Often, the value of this conversation isn't the AI's recommendations—it's the *clarity you gain* about your own work by having to explain it.

People report things like:

- "I didn't realise how much time I was spending on [task] until the AI asked about it"
- "Talking through my role, I realised I could combine AI with [other tool] in a way I'd never considered"
- "Just articulating my challenges to the AI helped me see a solution on my own"

The AI is a thinking partner, not a replacement for your thinking.

## Practical Tips for Your Consultation

### **Be Honest and Specific**

- Don't try to impress the AI with polished answers
- The more honest you are about constraints and challenges, the better the recommendations
- "We have no budget," "I don't have time to learn new tools," "My institution is skeptical of AI"—these are valuable context

### **Ask Follow-Up Questions**

After getting recommendations, ask:

- "How would I actually implement the non-obvious ones?"
- "Which of these could I start with this week?"
- "What are the risks or drawbacks?"
- "How would I know if this is working?"

### **Test the Recommendations**

- Pick ONE obvious and ONE non-obvious recommendation
- Try them for a week or two
- Report back to AI: "I tried [recommendation]. Here's what happened..."
- AI will help you iterate toward what works

### **Treat It as Ongoing**

- This isn't a one-time conversation
- Your context changes; your needs evolve
- Run this consultation again in 3–6 months
- Each time you'll be ready for different ideas

### **Share What You Learn**

- If you discover something useful, share it with colleagues
- "I asked AI to help me discover how to use AI, and it suggested [X]. Here's how it's working for me..."
- Others might try similar approaches and share what they learn

## Why This is Different From Everything Else

Most guides tell you *what* to do:

- "Use these seven techniques with your students"
- "Structure your prompts using CRAFT"
- "Chain prompts together for complex analysis"

This guide helps you discover *what's right for you*:

- What matters in your context?
- What are you struggling with that AI could help with?
- What's possible that you hadn't considered?

By asking AI to diagnose before recommending, you get personalised guidance instead of generic advice.

## The Meta-Moment

Here's the beautiful irony: You're using this guide to understand how to use AI to discover how to use AI better. That's very meta.

But it's also very practical. And very powerful.

> **The best tool for learning how to use AI is AI itself.**

Lean into that. Ask questions. Be curious. Let AI surprise you with ideas you hadn't considered.

That's where the real value emerges.
