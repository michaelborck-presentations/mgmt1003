## **Executive Summary**

Deloitte is currently facing significant scrutiny following two high-profile incidents involving the use of generative AI in government consultancy reports. Specifically, the use of Azure OpenAI GPT-4o resulted in fabricated references and quotes in reports for the Australian and Canadian governments.

These incidents have prompted a partial refund in Australia and have sparked a global conversation regarding stricter oversight and transparency in AI use within public sector contracts.

### **Key Issue: AI Hallucinations**

The core issue identified in these reports is "hallucination"—a phenomenon where generative AI models invent plausible-sounding but entirely false information, citations, or data points.

## **Australia: The DEWR Report Incident**

**Contract Value:** \~AU$440,000 (approx. $290,000 USD)

**Client:** Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR)

In December 2024, the Australian Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) commissioned Deloitte to review its **Targeted Compliance Framework**, a welfare system designed to monitor and penalize jobseekers.

### **The Error**

The resulting report, published in July 2025, was found to contain numerous fabricated citations. Notable errors included:

* Non-existent studies attributed to the **University of Sydney** and **Lund University**.  
* A false quote attributed to a federal court judge.

### **Discovery and Response**

The errors were flagged by **Dr. Christopher Rudge**, an academic at Sydney University, and subsequently reported by the *Australian Financial Review*.

Following this discovery:

1. **Admission:** Deloitte confirmed the use of Azure OpenAI GPT-4o in the drafting process.  
2. **Correction:** A revised version of the report was issued in September 2025\. This version included a formal disclosure of AI use and removed the fabricated references.  
3. **Financial Consequence:** Deloitte agreed to refund the final installment of its consultancy fee. While the exact refund amount was not disclosed, the total contract value was approximately AU$440,000.  
4. **Government Stance:** Despite the fabrication of supporting citations, the Australian government maintained that the report's substantive findings, recommendations, and core analysis remained valid.

## **Canada: Newfoundland and Labrador Inquiry**

**Contract Value:** $1.6 million

**Client:** Government of Newfoundland and Labrador

Following the Australian incident, Deloitte faced similar allegations in Canada in November 2025 regarding a $1.6 million report addressing a healthcare staffing crisis.

### **The Allegations**

The report allegedly contained fabricated citations used to validate claims regarding:

* Recruitment strategies.  
* The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers.

Upon direction from the Department of Health and Community Services to verify the accuracy of the report, Deloitte acknowledged that **four citations were incorrect**.

As of December 8, 2025, unlike the Australian case, no public information has been released regarding a potential refund for the Canadian report.

## **Industry Implications and Response**

These incidents serve as a case study for the risks associated with integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into professional services without adequate guardrails.

### **The Risk of Hallucinations**

Experts warn that hallucination rates in large language models can vary significantly, sometimes reaching as high as 45% in specific contexts. This underscores the necessity for:

* **Rigorous Human Review:** A "human-in-the-loop" approach to verify all AI-generated output.  
* **Traceability:** Clear documentation of where AI was used.  
* **Transparency Clauses:** Stronger contractual obligations requiring firms to disclose AI usage.

### **Policy Changes**

The Australian government is reportedly considering the inclusion of stricter AI-usage clauses in future consultancy contracts to prevent recurrence.

While Deloitte has previously faced fines for audit and ethical violations in India, China, Colombia, and Canada, those cases were unrelated to AI. These recent events mark a specific pivot in professional misconduct allegations focused on the technological integrity of deliverables.
